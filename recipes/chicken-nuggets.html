            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into large chunks</li>

        <h4>steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place a wire cooling rack on top and spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Put chicken into a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Add ranch dressing; seal and shake bag to coat chicken evenly</li>
            <li>Mix panko, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and parsley together in a bowl; pour into bag with chicken.</li>
            <li>Seal and shake bag to coat thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Remove from bag; place on rack in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Turn broiler on high; broil until crispy, about 1 minute.</li>
        </ol>
